General Notes:
 * Use test configuration files. For TG-20 change the parameter as shown.
 * Make sure level0/DLAC_4BIT_HACK is set to True. Some messages don't
   support 6 bit tab spacing as required by the standard.
 * 'Passes all tests' doesn't actually mean that. It passes all the tests
   it can pass, or could provide information to be used to pass a test.
   'Fisb-decode' is a parsing and back-end database for FIS-B. Not a
   display system with a user interface.
 * All winds forecasts have the altitudes stripped off. These are easy to
   put back and allows for construction of better displays (see localwx).

Worst. Test. Ever. There is a patch that needs to be applied
before running this test. This test makes up TFR-NOTAMs, SIGMETs,
and AIRMETs that do not in any way resemble what the FAA would send.
So if your system, like 'fisb-decode', checks for sane data,
this test fails out of the gate. The patch will make the feeble
attempts at data passable. The instructions are confusing--
the pictures make look like the graphics appear in a sequential
fashion. In reality, the graphics pretty much happen
all at once. All other
test groups except this one stop sending packets, then have one final
check. Nope. There are two minutes of useless packets after the
final check. For no purpose.

With BYPASS_TWGO_SMART_EXPIRATION set to True, the NOTAM-TFRs
will persist, even though the contents are expired. This is
acceptable for the test.

TG20
----

With BYPASS_TWGO_SMART_EXPIRATION set to True, at trigger 8,
various reports which are shown as not present will still be present.
The status of all of these reports are expired, but since we need to
keep them around for an hour after the last time they were sent, the
message will not have expired (even though the parts are expired).
This is expected behavior.

Set level2/BYPASS_TWGO_SMART_EXPIRATION to False. Most tests do better
with this set to True (although leave it at False for normal use).
This TG doesn't send refresh messages so messages will expire after an
hour or so (before their stop date).

With level2/BYPASS_TWOGO_SMART_EXPIRATION set to False, toward the end of the
test new versions of the 06_HR G-AIRMETS are sent out that are already
expired. This means that the CRL that should be complete will not be
complete (because of the two 06_HR G-AIRMETS, otherwise it is complete).
I think fisb-decode's behavior is correct here. The test actually
states that it doesn't apply to the two 06_HR G-AIRMETS, so think we are safe
here.

This TG is the 'master class' of all test groups. Extremely well constructed,
tests lots of concepts not tested in other groups. Tests many
realistic edge-cases. I understood lots of
concepts much better after struggling to get this TG working.
