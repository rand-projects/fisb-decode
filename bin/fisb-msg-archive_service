# Script used by  fisb-msg-archive.service to
# archive fis-b messages (usually to
# ../runtime/msg-archive).
#
# This service will only run level 0 and its only
# purpose in life is to archive messages. It does no
# processing. If you plan to run harvest, do not run this.
# Instead, use the services for harvest and just set
# ARCHIVE_MESSAGES and ARCHIVE_DIRECTORY to the correct
# values in ../fisb/level0/level0Config.py
#
# YOU WILL NEED TO CHANGE THE PATHS BOTH IN
# THIS FILE AND ../misc/fisb-msg-archive.service
# TO MATCH YOUR SYSTEM.
#
# You also need to change the configuration file
# to ../fisb/level0/level0Config.py for the correct
# setup.
#
# Pay special attention to the following configuration parameters.
#
# ARCHIVE_MESSAGES = True
# ARCHIVE_DIRECTORY = '../runtime/msg-archive'
# WRITE_MESSAGE_TO_FILE = False
# SHOW_MESSAGE_SOURCE = False
# CALCULATE_RSR = False
